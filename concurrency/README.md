# This project demonstrates how Go handles concurrency and parallelism

In my terms the basic difference between concurrency and parallelism is this:

Concurrency - You switch between sipping a coffee and talking - Lot's of Context Switch

Parallelism - You talk and drive at the same time - No Context Switch
